# **1. Introduction**

The Tycho dataset is a comprehensive database that provides valuable information on disease in the United States at both the state and city level. This dataset spans over a century, from 1887 to 2014, providing a wealth of information on the patterns and trends of diseases across the country.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for better preparedness and response to large-scale pandemics. Despite significant advances in science and medicine, the world still faces challenges in dealing with outbreaks of this magnitude. In particular, the substantial increase in long-distance travel by land, sea, and air has made it easier for diseases to spread rapidly across the globe.

It is essential to recognize the importance of data such as the Tycho dataset, which can provide valuable insights into the patterns and trends of diseases over time. By analyzing this data, we can identify the areas and populations most at risk and develop targeted interventions to prevent and mitigate the spread of diseases. This, in turn, can help us better prepare for future pandemics and ensure a more effective response when they occur.

# **2.1 Problem definition**

The problem of resource allocation and pandemic preparedness is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive approach. In addition to having the ability to detect when and where pandemics occur, it is crucial to have a well-equipped healthcare system that is tailored to the specific needs of different regions. Given the wide variations in climate, distance, and population density across the United States, it can be challenging to prepare adequately. For example, a region that experiences extreme weather conditions may require different resources compared to a region with a high population density. Similarly, different regions may be dealing with different diseases, making it unwise to have a generalized approach towards healthcare. As such, a targeted approach that takes into account the unique characteristics of each region is necessary. By doing so, we can ensure that resources are allocated appropriately, and our healthcare system is better prepared to handle pandemics in the future.

# **3. Objectives**

The main objective of this research is to explore the relationship between geography and the prevalence of diseases. By identifying the types of diseases that are prevalent in each region, we can better allocate resources and direct them towards prevention and treatment in areas that require the most attention. This will not only save resources and logistics, but it will also help us to develop tailored strategies that are best suited to the unique challenges faced by each region. Additionally, by investigating the specific environmental factors that contribute to the spread of disease, we can gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which geography interacts with other variables to influence health outcomes. Overall, this research aims to shed light on the complex interplay between geography and disease and to develop more effective approaches to mitigating the impact of these diseases on vulnerable populations.

# **5. Analysis Protocol**
The analysis was divided into subsections. The working steps are introduced below. 

Before to start the analysis the required libraries were loaded 
```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)
library(dygraphs)
library(treemap)
library(xts) 
```


## **5.1 Data loading and cleanup** 
Explain the data loading and cleanup

**Data loading**
How the data is loaded

```{r}
df <- read.csv("Data/ProjectTycho_Level2_v1.1.0_0/ProjectTycho_Level2_v1.1.0.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ',')
```

**Data cleanup** 

How the data is cleaned
```{r}
#Convert date columns to date
df$from_date <- ymd(df$from_date)
df$to_date <- ymd(df$to_date)
```


## **Playground (DELETE LATER)**
```{r}
unique(df$country)
unique(df$loc_type)
unique(df$state)
```
```{r}
TX_DF = df[df$state == "TX" & df$loc_type == "STATE"  & df$event == "CASES", ]

```
```{r}
unique(TX_DF$event)
```
```{r}
results = aggregate(TX_DF$number, by=list(Category=TX_DF$from_date), FUN=sum)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = results) +
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Category, y = x))
```
```{r}
#lets investigate now how diseases affected different states
CITIES_df = df[df$loc_type == "CITY"  & df$event == "CASES", ]
```

```{r}
results_city = aggregate(CITIES_df$number, by=list(Category=CITIES_df$from_date), FUN=sum)
```
