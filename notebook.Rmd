# **1. Introduction**

The Tycho dataset is a comprehensive database that provides valuable information on disease in the United States at both the state and city level. This dataset spans over a century, from 1887 to 2014, providing a wealth of information on the patterns and trends of diseases across the country.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for better preparedness and response to large-scale pandemics. Despite significant advances in science and medicine, the world still faces challenges in dealing with outbreaks of this magnitude. In particular, the substantial increase in long-distance travel by land, sea, and air has made it easier for diseases to spread rapidly across the globe.

It is essential to recognize the importance of data such as the Tycho dataset, which can provide valuable insights into the patterns and trends of diseases over time. By analyzing this data, we can identify the areas and populations most at risk and develop targeted interventions to prevent and mitigate the spread of diseases. This, in turn, can help us better prepare for future pandemics and ensure a more effective response when they occur.

# **2.1 Problem definition**

The problem of resource allocation and pandemic preparedness is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive approach. In addition to having the ability to detect when and where pandemics occur, it is crucial to have a well-equipped healthcare system that is tailored to the specific needs of different regions. Given the wide variations in climate, distance, and population density across the United States, it can be challenging to prepare adequately. For example, a region that experiences extreme weather conditions may require different resources compared to a region with a high population density. Similarly, different regions may be dealing with different diseases, making it unwise to have a generalized approach towards healthcare. As such, a targeted approach that takes into account the unique characteristics of each region is necessary. By doing so, we can ensure that resources are allocated appropriately, and our healthcare system is better prepared to handle pandemics in the future.

# **3. Objectives**

The main objective of this research is to explore the relationship between geography and the prevalence of diseases. By identifying the types of diseases that are prevalent in each region, we can better allocate resources and direct them towards prevention and treatment in areas that require the most attention. This will not only save resources and logistics, but it will also help us to develop tailored strategies that are best suited to the unique challenges faced by each region. Additionally, by investigating the specific environmental factors that contribute to the spread of disease, we can gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which geography interacts with other variables to influence health outcomes. Overall, this research aims to shed light on the complex interplay between geography and disease and to develop more effective approaches to mitigating the impact of these diseases on vulnerable populations.

# **4. Methods**

The method consists in analysing and comparing the disease data on state level, to understand if and how diseases affect different states. We assume that there should be a difference, due to climate, so we investigate if states with similar climates will show similar trends in disease.

library(usmap)
library(scales)
library(ggrepel)
```


## **5.1 Data loading and cleanup** 
Explain the data loading and cleanup

***5.1.a Data loading***
How the data is loaded

```{r}
df <- read.csv("Data/ProjectTycho_Level2_v1.1.0_0/ProjectTycho_Level2_v1.1.0.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ',')
```

***5.1.b Data cleanup*** 

How the data is cleaned and prepared
```{r}
#Convert date columns to date
df$from_date <- ymd(df$from_date)
df$to_date <- ymd(df$to_date)
```

**5.2 Overall disease view**
Since we start from the assumption that geography affects diseases, the first step is to look at the data, seeing what is the disease with most cases for each state.

```{r}
#This will be the first graph: A map, showing all states and the disease with most cases for each state
#first step, get the data for the map
#select only the city data
CITIES_CASES_df = df[df$loc_type == "CITY"  & df$event == "CASES", ]

#create a temporary df, with the sum of all cases
max_state_cases_df<-CITIES_CASES_df %>%
  group_by(state, disease) %>%
  summarize(total_cases=sum(number))

#select the disease with most cases for each state

max_state_cases_df <- max_state_cases_df %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  top_n(1, total_cases)

#now plot the map with the diseases
plot_usmap(data = max_state_cases_df, values = "disease", color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Top disease by cases (All time)") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")


```
From the graph we can see that the main diseases in number of cases throughout history are:
-Chickenpox
-Influenza
-Measles
-Smallpox

Only looking at the cases is not enough though. The dataset also contains death information for the diseases, so the same process is applied to find what are the most deadly diseases throughout history by state.

```{r}
#first step, get the data for the map
#select only the city data, and only the deaths
CITIES_DEATH_df = df[df$loc_type == "CITY"  & df$event == "DEATHS", ]

#create a temporary df, with the sum of all cases
max_state_df<-CITIES_DEATH_df %>%
  group_by(state, disease) %>%
  summarize(total_cases=sum(number))

#select the disease with most cases for each state

max_state_df <- max_state_df %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  top_n(1, total_cases)

#now plot the map with the diseases
plot_usmap(data = max_state_df, values = "disease", color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Top disease by cases (All time)") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```
Looking at both maps, we can see that the disease with most cases is not the most deadly, or is it? When looking at the dataset, we find that the death data for measles, for example, is missing. THe solution for that, is to no use measles data when comparing the information from deaths.
#Show table with all diseases, cases and deaths



The data come from a long history, thus, some erradicated diseases like Measles and Smallpox are still the top diseases in many states. One way of assessing if this information is still useful is checking that for those diseases, how they varied through time.

***5.3 Historical analysis ***

To see how those diseases behaved in history, we can look at the number of cases per year countrywide:
```{r}
#Sum the total number of cases of each disease for each day
results_cases_city<- CITIES_CASES_df %>%
  group_by(from_date, disease) %>%
  summarize(total_cases=sum(number))

#create a year column
results_cases_city$year<-as.numeric(format(results_cases_city$from_date, "%Y"))

#select only the diseases that showed in the map
sub_set_df<-results_cases_city %>% filter(disease == "CHICKENPOX [VARICELLA]" | disease == "INFLUENZA" | disease == "MEASLES" | disease == "SMALLPOX")

#aggregate by year and disease
sub_set_df<- sub_set_df %>%
  group_by(year, disease) %>%
  summarize(total_cases=sum(total_cases))

#Plot the data
options(repr.plot.width = 2, repr.plot.height = 10)
ggplot(sub_set_df, aes(x = year, y = total_cases)) +
  facet_grid(disease ~ ., shrink = FALSE) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = seq(1875, 2025, 25), color = "red", alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(title = "Cases of disease by year", x = "", y = "") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
```
***5.3 Historical and Geographical Analysis ***

From the previous view we can see that those diseases only happened in a few moments through history and either were not counted anymore or were eradicated. [Add measles eradication studies here]. The red lines show every 25 years since the start of the chart. The next step is to generate a different map for those periods, to see how different diseases affected each state at each point in time;

-Period 0 1875-1900 *
-Period 1 1900-1925
-Period 2 1925-1950
-Period 3 1950-1957
-Period 4 1975-2000
-Period 5 2000-2025 *

* For the lower and upper bound, data is incomplete, but for the sakeness of keeping equal time periods they will be considered.

```{r}
#first step, get the data for the map
#select only the city data
CITIES_df = df[df$loc_type == "CITY"  & df$event == "CASES", ]

#create a period column, starting on 1875, every 25 years is a period
CITIES_df$period<-(as.numeric(format(CITIES_df$from_date, "%Y"))-1875)%/%25

#sum all cases of the same disease, by period and state
STATE_df<-CITIES_df %>%
  group_by(state, disease, period) %>%
  summarize(total_cases=sum(number))

STATE_df_0 <- STATE_df %>% filter(period == 0)
STATE_df_1 <- STATE_df %>% filter(period == 1)
STATE_df_2 <- STATE_df %>% filter(period == 2)
STATE_df_3 <- STATE_df %>% filter(period == 3)
STATE_df_4 <- STATE_df %>% filter(period == 4)
STATE_df_5 <- STATE_df %>% filter(period == 5)

#select the top disease per state in the periods

max_state_0_df <- STATE_df_0 %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  top_n(1, total_cases)

max_state_1_df <- STATE_df_1 %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  top_n(1, total_cases)

max_state_2_df <- STATE_df_2 %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  top_n(1, total_cases)

max_state_3_df <- STATE_df_3 %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  top_n(1, total_cases)

max_state_4_df <- STATE_df_4 %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  top_n(1, total_cases)

max_state_5_df <- STATE_df_5 %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  top_n(1, total_cases)

# Define a color palette for the diseases
# Define a color palette for the diseases
disease_colors <- c("SMALLPOX" = "blue", "CHLAMYDIA" = "green", "CHICKENPOX [VARICELLA]" = "red", "HEPATITIS A" = 
                      "purple", "MEASLES" = "orange", "POLIOMYELITIS" = "yellow", "INFLUENZA" = "cyan", "TYPHOID 
                    FEVER [ENTERIC FEVER]" = "pink", "SCARLET FEVER" = "brown")

# Map diseases to colors in each period
max_state_0_df$disease_color <- disease_colors[max_state_0_df$disease]
max_state_1_df$disease_color <- disease_colors[max_state_1_df$disease]
max_state_2_df$disease_color <- disease_colors[max_state_2_df$disease]
max_state_3_df$disease_color <- disease_colors[max_state_3_df$disease]
max_state_4_df$disease_color <- disease_colors[max_state_4_df$disease]
max_state_5_df$disease_color <- disease_colors[max_state_5_df$disease]


# Plot each period map with the diseases using the assigned colors
plot_usmap(data = max_state_0_df, values = "disease", color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = disease_colors, name = "Top disease in state") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  ggtitle("Top disease by state, period from 1875-1900 *")

plot_usmap(data = max_state_1_df, values = "disease", color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = disease_colors, name = "Top disease in state") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  ggtitle("Top disease by state, period from 1900-1925")

plot_usmap(data = max_state_2_df, values = "disease", color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = disease_colors, name = "Top disease in state") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  ggtitle("Top disease by state, period from 1925-1950")

plot_usmap(data = max_state_3_df, values = "disease", color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = disease_colors, name = "Top disease in state") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  ggtitle("Top disease by state, period from 1950-1975")

plot_usmap(data = max_state_4_df, values = "disease", color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = disease_colors, name = "Top disease in state") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  ggtitle("Top disease by state, period from 1975-2000")

plot_usmap(data = max_state_5_df, values = "disease", color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = disease_colors, name = "Top disease in state") +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  ggtitle("Top disease by state, period from 2000-2025 *")
```
From the maps it is possible to observe that the diseases with most cases, more specifically Measles, seem to spread regardless of the region, affecting the whole country. And also that the data is not reliable when used for comparison between states, since the data is missing.

# ***5.4 Lethality analysis ***

A important aspect to be analized, is the lethality of diseases, since the absolute number of cases and deaths can be misleading due to different population size in each state. Lethality is usually calculated by number of deaths divided by the area population, but the dataset does not contain that information. An alternative is to use the number o deaths divided by the number of cases, as shown next:

```{r}
#Lethality analysis
lethality_df <- df

lethality_df <- lethality_df %>%
  mutate(deaths = ifelse(event == "DEATHS", number, 0),
         cases = ifelse(event == "CASES", number, 0)) %>%
  select(-event, -number) 

disease_df <- lethality_df %>%
  group_by(disease) %>%
  summarize(total_cases=sum(cases), total_deaths=sum(deaths))

#Select only diseases that have both deaths and cases recorded
disease_df <- disease_df %>%
  filter(total_cases > 0, total_deaths > 0, total_cases>= total_deaths)



ggplot(data = disease_df, aes(x = total_deaths, y = total_cases, col=disease)) +
geom_point(show.legend= FALSE) +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = disease),
                  box.padding   = 0.35, 
                  point.padding = 0.5,
                  segment.color = 'grey50',
                  show.legend= FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = 'log2') +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log2')
```
The chart shows a correlation between cases and deaths, as expected. The number of deaths should never be higher than the number of cases, as it would make little sense. Both axis show absolute values, so it is a good comparison about the scale of each disease, but not clear enough to know how they compare in terms of lethality.

```{r}
#Calculate lethality of each disease
disease_df$lethality <- (disease_df$total_deaths / disease_df$total_cases)

ggplot(data = disease_df, aes(x = disease, y = lethality, fill=disease), vjust = -0.5) +
geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_text(data = disease_df, aes(x = disease, y = lethality, label = disease),angle=90, vjust = 0, hjust=0.05) +
  theme(legend.position = "none",  
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())


```
Knowing the most lethal diseaseas can help find a direction on what treatments should be prioritized and what diseases should be prevented from spreading at all cost. But going back to the main subject of the geographical effects on disease lethality, the next graph will illustrate how the letality varies in each disease for each state:

```{r}
#now group lethality by state and disease

state_disease_df <- lethality_df %>%
  group_by(disease, state) %>%
  summarize(total_cases=sum(cases), total_deaths=sum(deaths))

#Select only diseases that have both deaths and cases recorded
state_disease_df <- state_disease_df %>%
  filter(total_cases > 0, total_deaths > 0, total_cases>= total_deaths)

#calculate lethality
state_disease_df$lethality <- (state_disease_df$total_deaths / state_disease_df$total_cases)

ggplot(state_disease_df, aes(x=disease, y=lethality, fill=disease)) +
    geom_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE, alpha=0.2) +
    theme(legend.position="none", axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust = 1))+
   ggtitle(" Data distribution by regions")

```
The graph shows that there are outliers in lethality, but low and high, for certain diseases: Diphtheria, Influenza, Pellagra, Smallpox and Typhoid Fever. For reference, Tuberculosis will also be included, as it is highly lethal but more evenly distributed

```{r}
#create lethality maps

small_pox_df <- state_disease_df %>%
  filter(disease == "SMALLPOX")

flu_df <- state_disease_df %>%
  filter(disease == "INFLUENZA")

diph_df <- state_disease_df %>%
  filter(disease == "DIPHTHERIA")

pell_df <- state_disease_df %>%
  filter(disease == "PELLAGRA")

typho_df <- state_disease_df %>%
  filter(disease == "TYPHOID FEVER [ENTERIC FEVER]")

tub_df <- state_disease_df %>%
  filter(disease == "TUBERCULOSIS [PHTHISIS PULMONALIS]")

#now plot the map with the diseases
plot_usmap(data = small_pox_df, values = "lethality", color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "Smallpox lethality") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")

plot_usmap(data = flu_df, values = "lethality", color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "INFLUENZA lethality") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")

plot_usmap(data = diph_df, values = "lethality", color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "DIPHTHERIA lethality") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")

plot_usmap(data = pell_df, values = "lethality", color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "PELLAGRA lethality") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")

plot_usmap(data = typho_df, values = "lethality", color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "TYPHOID FEVER [ENTERIC FEVER] lethality") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")


plot_usmap(data = tub_df, values = "lethality", color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "TUBERCULOSIS [PHTHISIS PULMONALIS] lethality") + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")


```
The maps show that certain states, mainly in the northeast, are more dangerous for those diseases, all of them being respiratory diseases. A takeaway from thhat data is that perhaps the air pollution in those heavily industrialized areas can generate higher risk of illness and higher chance of death. So resources for respiratory diseases should be prioritized in the states of that region.
